# hello-world
My first GitHub repo.

This is how I finally came here:
* Learned again some Scala
* Checked out the Kotlin language (of which I hadn't had heard yet!)
* Read some information on ScalaCheck and the sbt tool
* Remotely touched through machine learning topics
* Studied the Elixir language for a few days (w/ a little outdated Erlang background)
* Checked the current IDEA version
* Looked for Scala w/ sbt 
* Stumbled over the Scala Tutorials
* Created my first GitHub account and repository
