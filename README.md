# hello-world
My first GitHub repo.

This is how I finally came here:
* Learned again some Scala
* Checked out Kotlin
* Read some information on ScalaCheck and sbt
* Scooped through machine learning topics
* Did some Elixir
* Checked the current IDEA version
* Looked for Scala w/ sbt 
* Stumbled over the Scala Tutorials
* Created my first GitHub account and repository
